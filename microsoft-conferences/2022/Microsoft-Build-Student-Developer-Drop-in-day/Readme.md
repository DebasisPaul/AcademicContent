Welcome, Guide, Connect!

To celebrate the close of Microsoft Build and Spring exams coming to an end, Reactor London is thrilled to invite students from London and across the UK to Microsoft Build: Student Developer Drop-in Day.

This Open House is a drop-in event - come along to the bits which are most relevant to you!

Meet with fellow students, Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors, Microsoft Interns, Microsoft MVPs, the Microsoft University Recruiting team but most importantly relax and have fun.

Find out more about what happened at Microsoft Build and discover Microsoft Learn. Meet local data scientists, web devs and cybersecurity engineers for hands-on talks about their recent experience and careers. We’ll introduce you to the Student Ambassador program and Imagine Cup by sharing moments of innovation from the past 20 years. And we’ll talk Microsoft internships.

You’ll also be able to take part in a special AI Gaming Challenge!

This is your chance to celebrate, grab a bite to eat, swag some swag, learn something new and meet someone fresh in the Microsoft community.

### About Notebooks

This course makes extensive use of Jupyter Notebooks which provide an easy way for you to experiment with programming concepts in an interactive fashion.

Jupyter Notebooks are divided into cells. Each cell contains either text written in the Markdown markup language or a space in which to write and execute computer code. Because all the code resides inside code cells, you can run each code cell inline rather than using a separate Python interactive window.

> **Note**: These notebooks are designed to have you run code cells one by one, and several code cells contain deliberate errors for demonstration purposes. As a result, if you use the **Cell** > **Run All** command, some code cells past the error won't be run. To resume running the code in each case, use **Cell** > **Run All Below** from the cell after the error.

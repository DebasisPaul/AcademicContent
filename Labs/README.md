# Selected Azure Labs on Microsoft Learn

Microsoft Learn gives you the ability to run all of these (and more!) great labs for free - without using your Azure credits. Check it out at [docs.microsoft.com/learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-cxa)!

These resources include hands-on coding labs designed to help Computer Science faculty and students learn how to deploy solutions to the Azure cloud involving common scenarios such as Web development, AI and machine learning, data science, and IoT using cross-platform technologies. Most labs are compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux and take 60 to 90 minutes to complete.

Before you start, make sure you have access to a Microsoft Azure subscription. Students can get a free Azure subscription and credits here:

* [Azure For Students ($100 in Azure - no credit card required)](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academiccontent-github-cxa)
* [Azure For Students Starter FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students-starter-faq/?WT.mc_id=academiccontent-github-cxa)
* [Azure Free Account - 30 days with $200 credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=academiccontent-github-cxa)

The labs fall into six general categories:

| Categories | Description | 
| - | - |
| **AI and Machine Learning** | Build bots and apps backed by AI and ML using Azure and Azure Cognitive Services and popular open-source libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow. | |
| **Azure Services** | Deploy serverless code with Azure Functions, run Docker containers, use Azure to build Blockchain networks and more. | 
| **Big Data and Analytics** | Spin up Apache Spark Clusters, Use Hadoop to extract information from big datasets or use Power BI to explore and visualize data. | 
| **Deep Learning** | These labs build on each other to introduce tools and libraries for AI. They're labeled 200-400 level to indicate level of technical detail. | 
| **Internet-of-Things** | Use Azure to collect and stream IoT data securely and in real time. | 
| **Web Development** | Quickly create a scalable web apps using Node, PHP, MySQL on easy-to-use tools like Visual Studio Code and GitHub.|

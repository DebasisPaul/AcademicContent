This repo provides technical resources to help students and faculty learn about Azure and teach others. The content covers cross-platform scenarios in AI and machine learning, data science, web development, mobile app dev, internet of things, and DevOps. It also includes interesting tech talks and engaging, fun tech challenges that Microsoft leads at student hackathons and [Imagine Cup](http://www.imaginecup.com).

**Important:** We are migrating to [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/) | If you can't find what you're looking for in this repo, check out the labs on Microsoft Learn too. Many of these labs have their own built-in Azure sandbox making it easier for faculty and students to learn without requiring an Azure Subscription.

Students can get free Azure credits to explore these resources here:

* [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academiccontent-github-cxa) | $100 in Azure for 12 months with free tier of services - no credit card required with academic verification
* [Azure for Students Starter](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students-starter-faq/?WT.mc_id=academiccontent-github-cxa) | use select Azure products like App Services for free - no credit card required with academic verification
* [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=academiccontent-github-cxa) | $200 in Azure for one month with free tier of services - requires a credit card and probably the best fit for faculty evaluating Azure for course instruction unless your organization has a grant or enterprise agreement.

## Structure of the docs part of this repository

This repository is designed to build a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) site that is hosted using GitHub Pages.

The content of this site lives in the [docs](./docs) folder. The main page is constructed from the [README.md](./docs/README.md) in that folder, and the side bar is made of the contents of the [content](./docs/content) folder.

### Building the docs

To build these docs, you will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. Once you have this installed, install VuePress:

```sh
npm install vuepress
```

To build the docs, use the [`deploy.sh`](./deploy.sh) script. This script will build the docs, then push them to the `gh-pages` branch of a given fork of this project. You pass the GitHub user/org name to the script. This way you can test the build offline, then push to the parent as part of an automated script.

```sh
deploy.sh <org>
```

## Contributing

We 💖**love**💖 contributions. In fact, we want students, faculty, researchers and life-long learners to contribute to this repo, either by adding links to existing content, or building content. Please read the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more.
